# Landsat-Photoshop-Processing
A script to quicken the speed of processing. 
Download and open "RGB Conversion Edited.jsx" in ExtendScript. 
In the application link area to the upper left, select Adobe Photoshop CC. 
Then hit the "play" button in the upper right to run.

Other files that I used for specific functions in the main code are available if you want to edit and use them on your own.
I used ScriptListener for some parts, like the merging, and other parts were coded "by hand."
